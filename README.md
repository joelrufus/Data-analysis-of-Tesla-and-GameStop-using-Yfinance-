# Python Project for Data Science

This repository contains the final project and code assignments completed as part of the "Python Project for Data Science" course offered by IBM on Coursera.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Python programming and various data science libraries to analyze and visualize financial data from Tesla and GameStop. The key objectives of the project include:

- Extracting stock data using `yfinance`
- Web scraping revenue data
- Cleaning and preparing data for analysis
- Creating visualizations to represent the data

## Project Structure

- `data analysis of tesla and gamestop.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code to extract, analyze, and visualize Tesla  and gamestock stock data.
- 
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- Python: Programming language used for the project.
- yfinance: Library to extract stock data.
- BeautifulSoup: Library for web scraping.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization library.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for developing and running code.

## File

### data analysis of tesla and gamestop.ipynb

- Extracts Tesla and stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- Plots the Tesla and  stock data using Matplotlib.
- Extracts GameStop stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- Scrapes GameStop revenue data from Macrotrends using BeautifulSoup.
- Cleans and prepares the scraped data.
- Plots the GameStop stock data and revenue data using Matplotlib.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install yfinance beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`data analysis of tesla and gamestop.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in the notebooks to execute the code.
